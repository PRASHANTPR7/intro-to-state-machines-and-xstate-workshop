# XState Viz

This lesson is actually pretty simple. Often, it would be nice to "see" our state machine. Be able to visualize our states, the transitions between them, and any actions that are fired as a result of transitions. Well, there's a tool for that.

Check out [XState Viz](https://xstate.js.org/viz). This is an online tool for visualizing state machines. Use this with any state machine you're writing and need some help getting just right.

My little bonus tip: Keep the [Prettier playgroud](https://prettier.io/playground) open in another tab. It's easy to make mistakes in the small coding window provided to you on XState Viz. Having Prettier around to validate and prettify your code can be very helpful.
