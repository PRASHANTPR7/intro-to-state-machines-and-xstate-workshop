# Section 2 - Learn by Building

In the previous section, we worked through some of the difficulties of coding a simple light bulb correctly. There's a few gotchas and it's easy to wind up in an impossible state if we're not careful.

Near the end of that section, we wrote a better light bulb function that got rid of impossible states entirely. However, our solution wasn't something we could easily apply to other systems and model easily. We imperatively handled all our state management by creating our own enum of states and by handling state transitions in each of the methods individually. We want a way for this to happen declaratively, and to generalize how we do this. Lucky for all of us, there are state machines.

Now, I want to take the last idea I talked about in the previous section, that "state" is a directed graph, and build upon that. I think one of the best ways to learn something is to _build_ something, learning and using concepts along the way. So that's what we're going to do, we're going to build a finite state machine library.
